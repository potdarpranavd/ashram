        <h2>Linux Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            While there are many good linux distributions, I would always recommend <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a> based linux distributions. You can always install any packages on almost any linux distribution by recompiling.
            Main advantage of Arch is that it has AUR (Arch User Repository). It is community-driven App store where all apps are free and open-source. It is largest app store in linux community.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would recommend Manjaro linux for starters. It has good initial setup for gaming. Nvidia drivers has always worked for all my friends but for me.
