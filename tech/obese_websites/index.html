        <h2>Obese Websites</h2>
        <p>We are going through one of the worst crisis in the tech world: <b>Obesity</b>. Websites are becoming so bloat that one requires a <a href="https://danluu.com/web-bloat/#some-sites-will-use-a-lot-of-data">bandwidth of ~10-20 Mb</a> to download the whole page. The problem of website obesity is divided into 2 parts:

        <ol>
            <li>Bloat website</li>
            <li>Bloat ads</li>
        </ol>

            Every developer is fascinated with using the latest technology with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JavaScript_libraries">javascript</a>. In that process, they forget that it increases the load on browsers. While most modern computers are capable of handling that load, it is the developer's responsibility to write efficient code and get <a href="https://danluu.com/octopress-speedup/">webpage speedup</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that a website should be able to run on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210106074856/https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/potato">potato</a>. About 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the websites are <a href="https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/how-many-blogs/#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20there%20are%20more,billion%20websites%20in%20the%20world.">blogs</a> and require minimal user interaction. Such websites' footprint can greatly be reduced.

        <p>
            Web developers, it's not all your fault. After all your hard work optimizing the website, your client vomits his disgusting ads on which you have no control. The whole purpose of ads is to break your design and distract the user from the elegant design to the pile of shit.

            Every beacon, tracker and sharing button has it's collection of scripts that it needs to fetch from a third-party server. Each request comes packed with cookies. More cookies are the last thing your overweight website needs. These scripts get served from the pits of Mariana Trench and are perfect for malware. Never forget that advertisers and bankers are professional liars.

        <h3 id="probable_solution">Probable Solution</h3>
        <p>
            In this dark age of bloatware and adware, it's a requirement to have an ad-blocker to navigate the internet. 

            I'm not convinced that online publishing needs to be ad-supported at all. With rise in renewable energy sources, I hope that crypto-currency mining would be efficient so that users could donate directly to the website. Or users could <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">earn crypto-currency by watching the ads</a>. 
        </p>
        <h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3>
        <p>
            I would recommend the <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> extension to every browser. It's a free and open-source general-purpose blocker.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone has right to privacy irl and on the internet. <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a> helps in blocking third-party trackers and scripts. It's a free and open-source solution with privacy in mind.
