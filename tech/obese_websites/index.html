        <h2>Obese Websites</h2>
        <p>We are going through one of the worst crisis in the tech world: <b>Obesity</b>. Websites are becoming so bloat that one require a <a href="https://danluu.com/web-bloat/#some-sites-will-use-a-lot-of-data">bandwidth of ~10-20 Mb</a> to download the whole page. The problem of website obesity is divided into 2 parts:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bloat website</li>
            <li>Bloat ads</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Bloat website</h3>
        <p>
            Every developer is facinated with using latest technology with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JavaScript_libraries">javascripts</a>. In that process, they forget that it increases the load on browsers. While most modern computers are capable of handling that load, it is developer's responsibilty to write efficient code and get <a href="https://danluu.com/octopress-speedup/">webpage speedup</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that a website should be able to run on a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Potato%20PC">potato</a>. About 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the websites are <a href="https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/how-many-blogs/#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20there%20are%20more,billion%20websites%20in%20the%20world.">blogs</a> and require minimal user interaction. Such websites' footprint can greatly be reduced.
        </p>
        <h3>Bloat ads</h3>
        <p>
            Web developers its not all your fault. After all your hard work optimizing the website, your client vomits his disgusting ads on which you have no control. The whole purpose of ads is to break your design and distract the user from the elegant design to the pile of shit.
